                <p>At least 12 million people have fled their homes since Russia's invasion of Ukraine having to start
                    their lives all over again. If you want to help, but don't know how, you can offer help here: house
                    items, services, dinner, language practice, just yout time. Help locally. Help online. You can
                    browse through requests for help, maybe there is something you could do, just is not aware it's
                    needed. Many people are afraid of asking for help publicly on social media or intimidated with big
                    charity centeres refrain from seeking support. Here is a safe space, where nobody is going to judge
                    anybody. </p>
